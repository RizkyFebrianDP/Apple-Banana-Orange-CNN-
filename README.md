# Apple-Banana-Orange-CNN-
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of apples, oranges, and bananas. The model achieves high training and validation accuracy, effectively distinguishing between the three fruits.

Project Structure
data: This folder contains the training and validation datasets with subfolders for each fruit category (apple, orange, banana).
models: This folder stores the trained CNN model files.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for:
Data preprocessing and augmentation (e.g., data_preprocessing.ipynb)
Model definition and training (e.g., model_training.ipynb)
Model evaluation and visualization (e.g., model_evaluation.ipynb)
README.md: This file (you are currently reading it!)
Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:
tensorflow
keras
matplotlib
numpy
(image generator (for image augmentation)
